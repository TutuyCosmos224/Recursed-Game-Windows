# Recursed-Game-Windows
A 2D platformer game for Windows Desktop that combines dungeon RPG and mathematics in the same game. This is a collaborative project for a 3-day hackathon gor Binus University Game Development Jam 2021, made by Izra Giffari, Isaiah Jamiel, and myself. The Recursed v1.0 exe file is the game file which you can directly play, while the code of the game is located on the project files folder.
